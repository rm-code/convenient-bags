# Unpack Bags

Unpack Bags is a mod for [Project Zomboid](http://projectzomboid.com/) which allows you to quickly and conveniently unload bags.

Bags can be unpacked everywhere. They will dump their contents into the container in which they currently are located. This can be the player's inventory, a cupboard, or even the floor.
